# RAG-SQL-assistant


This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered SQL Assistant**.  
It generates SQL queries from natural language questions using **ChatGPT** and a database schema.  
The project demonstrates **vectorized schema retrieval**, **FAISS indexing**, and a **Streamlit UI**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Retrieve schema metadata from a dataset (tested with **Chinook DB** ðŸŽ¶).  
- Vectorize schema information and store it in a **FAISS index** for fast retrieval.  
- Use **RAG** (retrieved schemas + question) to generate SQL queries.  
- Interactive **Streamlit app** where you type a question and get SQL instantly.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The app is currently tested on the **Chinook SQLite dataset**.  
You can easily swap in other datasets (from **Kaggle Hub** or your own) by replacing the SQLite file.
